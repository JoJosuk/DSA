### Time complexity
- best case, worst case, expected case
- big O describes the rate of increase
- thats why we drop constants

### Space complexity
- recursion adds up as it takes up call stack

### big O facts
- multiply vs add

### amortized time

- sometimes the algorithm may take more than the regular time 
- consider the case of array insertion the worse case we know is O(1)....but it is the amortized time the actual time may be O(n)

### log n runtimes
binary search aka concurrent division
base of the logs dont matter
